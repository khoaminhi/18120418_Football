How to learn the codeing on php language which runs on the WARM Server.
### 1.
```
<?= is not the same as <?php
<?= is the same as <?php echo
<? is the same as <?php
```
### 2.Event (Jquery button event function) will not work if you delete the button.
You must add the JQuery event script into the page again.

### 3. Path
- I confuse PHP's path. I think the relative path start at the page's call.
For instance, you include the html file which contains the image href. You must change it according to start from
the calling page.
